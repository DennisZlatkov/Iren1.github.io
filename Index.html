    <h2> <b>Summary</b> </h2>

<div class="Summary_p">
<p> We want to create a persona (prob furry) that will be the main chrater of our videos
    and posts, and that will appeal to our targer audience of 18 to 24 year olds.<br><br>
    We want to use this persona to showcase our skills as digital artists and animators, and to
    attract supporters <br><br> who will donate to our Patreon, BuyMeACoffee, or Recolut accounts.
    We also want to make viral content that will increase our brand awareness and engagement :) </p>

<div class="Summary">
    <h2> <b>Points to consider</b> </h2>
</div>
<div class="Summary_p">
<p> Creating a furry persona is a creative and fun way to express yourself, but it also requires a lot of research, design, and development. You need to make sure that your persona is original, memorable, and relatable to your audience. You also need to give your persona a personality, a backstory, and a voice that will make them stand out from other furry characters online.<br><br>
    Making viral content is not easy or predictable. There are many factors that influence the virality of a video or a post, such as the platform, the algorithm, the timing, the trends, the quality, the emotion, the message, and the audience. You need to experiment with different types of content, formats, styles, and topics to see what works best for you and your audience. You also need to monitor your analytics and feedback to see what resonates with them and what doesn’t.<br><br>
    Building a loyal fanbase and getting supporters is a long-term process that requires consistency, authenticity, and value. You need to create content that not only entertains your audience, but also educates them, inspires them, or helps them in some way. You need to interact with your audience regularly, respond to their comments and questions, ask for their opinions and suggestions, and thank them for their support. You also need to offer them some incentives or rewards for supporting you financially, such as exclusive content, shoutouts, merchandise, or access to behind-the-scenes.

    <h2> <b>Step by step plan</b> </h2>
</div>
<div class="Summary_p">
<p> 
    1.Define your brand identity and vision. What is the name of your brand? What is the mission of your brand? What are the values of your brand? What are the goals of your brand? How do you want your audience to perceive your brand?<br><br>
    2.Define your target audience and niche. Who are you trying to reach with your content? What are their demographics, interests, preferences, needs, and pain points? What kind of content do they like to consume? Where do they hang out online? How can you solve their problems or fulfill their desires with your content?
    <br><br>
    3.Choose your platforms and channels. Which social media platforms do you want to use for your content? Which ones are most popular among your target audience? Which ones are most suitable for your type of content? How will you optimize your content for each platform? How will you cross-promote your content across different platforms?
    <br><br>
    4. Create a content strategy and calendar. What kind of content do you want to create? What are the themes, topics, formats, styles, and tones of your content? How often do you want to post new content? How will you plan ahead for seasonal events or trends? How will you balance between different types of content (e.g., educational vs entertaining)?
    <br><br>
    5.Create a marketing strategy and budget. How will you promote your content and reach new audiences? What are the best practices for SEO (search engine optimization), hashtags, keywords, captions, titles, thumbnails, etc.? How will you use paid ads or influencer marketing if needed? How much money can you afford to spend on marketing?
    <br><br>
    6.Create a monetization strategy and plan. How will you monetize your content and generate income from it? What are the best platforms or tools for receiving donations or tips from your supporters (e.g., Patreon, BuyMeACoffee, Revolut)? What are the benefits or perks that you can offer to your supporters in exchange for their financial support? How will you communicate with them and keep them engaged?
